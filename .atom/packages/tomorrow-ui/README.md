# Tomorrow UI theme for Atom

![screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paradox460/tomorrow-ui/master/screenshot.png)

Tomorrow is a clean, flat theme for atom based on the Tomorrow color scheme. It works quite well with the base16-tomorrow theme that ships with atom.

As a theme, it has a somewhat long history. This is, right now, just a series of CSS tweaks and personal changes to @mbullington's excellent [quantum-ui](https://github.com/mbullington/quantum-ui) theme, which is based on @brentd's [neutron-ui](https://atom.io/themes/neutron-ui), which was forked from the atom port of spacegray.

## Notes
I personally like coding with the Menlo font. It's installed by default on all macs, but if you're not on mac, you can generally use the excellent [Meslo](https://github.com/andreberg/Meslo-Font).
