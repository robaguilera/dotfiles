It works quite well with the base16-tomorrow theme that ships with atom.\n\nAs a theme, it has a somewhat long history. This is, right now, just a series of CSS tweaks and personal changes to @mbullington's excellent [quantum-ui](https://github.com/mbullington/quantum-ui) theme, which is based on @brentd's [neutron-ui](https://atom.io/themes/neutron-ui), which was forked from the atom port of spacegray.\n\n## Notes\nI personally like coding with the Menlo font. It's installed by default on all macs, but if you're not on mac, you can generally use the excellent [Meslo](https://github.com/andreberg/Meslo-Font).\n\n## License\n\nSee LICENSE.md for history\n\n```\nThe MIT License (MIT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2016 Jeff Sandberg\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
